On linux terminal inside VirtualBox the following commands need to be given to generate Transport Layer
Security over HTTP:
Moving to the root using
sudo -i
See tree of files inside the root:
tree
Creating directory:
mkdir -p ca/{root-ca,sub-ca,server}/{private,certs,newcerts,crl,csr}
See if the folders are created successfully:
tree ca
Changing the root of ca and sub ca private folder
chmod -v 700 ca/{root-ca,sub-ca,server}/private
Creating file index in both root ca and sub ca
touch ca/{root-ca,sub-ca}/index
Seeing ca tree again
tree ca
Generating hexadecimal random number of 16 charecter
openssl rand -hex 16
writing serial number of root ca
openssl rand -hex 16 > ca/root-ca/serial
writing serial number of sub ca
openssl rand -hex 16 > ca/sub-ca/serial
tree ca
moving to ca directory
cd ca
1. Generating private key for root ca, sub ca and server
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out root-ca/private/ca.key 4096
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out sub-ca/private/sub-ca.key 4096
openssl genrsa -out server/private/server.key 2048
reviewing the change
tree
Creating root ca.config
vim root-ca/root-ca.conf
Inserting the code from the link into the root-ca.config
https://sites.google.com/view/talhasiddique/home
Or from code: 1. root-ca.conf code
Save and exit
:wq
Tree
Moving inside root-ca
cd root-ca
2. Generating root certificates
Generating root ca certificate

openssl req -config root-ca.conf -key private/ca.key -new -x509 -days 7305 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out certs/ca.crt

Ensuring that the certificate has been created properly
openssl x509 -noout -in certs/ca.crt -text
Moving a step back and then to sub-ca
cd ../sub-ca
Creating root ca.config
vim sub-ca.conf
Inserting the code into sub-ca.config file
https://sites.google.com/view/talhasiddique/home
Or from sub-ca.conf code
Saving and exiting
:wq
Seeing the directory once again
tree
Requesting for sub ca certificate signing request.
openssl req -config sub-ca.conf -new -key private/sub-ca.key -sha256 -out
csr/sub-ca.csr
moving to the previous folder
cd –
Signing the request of sub ca by root ca
openssl ca -config root-ca.conf -extensions v3_intermediate_ca -days 3652
-notext -in ../sub-ca/csr/sub-ca.csr -out ../sub-ca/certs/sub-ca.crt
to confirm insert y
See directory
Tree
→.pem file has been generated
See the signing
cat index
→Root ca signed sub ca
Seeing detail
openssl x509 -noout -text -in ../sub-ca/certs/sub-ca.crt
3. Configuring server
Moving to server
cd ../server
Generating certificate signing request from server
openssl req -key private/server.key -new -sha256 -out csr/server.csr
cd ../sub-ca
Sub ca signing certificate request of server
openssl ca -config sub-ca.conf -extensions server_cert -days 365 -notext -
in ../server/csr/server.csr -out ../server/certs/server.crt
seeing detail
cat index
cd ../server/certs/
See the directory by using command:
ls
→ We can see that the server.crt file has been generated
Now, concating sub-ca.crt and server.crt and naming the new file chained.crt
cat server.crt ../../sub-ca/certs/sub-ca.crt > chained.crt
ls
cd ..
tree
echo "127.0.0.2 www.ATMS-localhost.com" >> /etc/hosts
ping www.AIMS-localhost.com
Turning on the ssl port
openssl s_server -accept 443 -www -key private/server.key -cert
certs/server.crt -CAfile ../sub-ca/certs/sub-ca.crt
Opening new terminal
Again to root
su -
See the port number used by different Ip addresses
ss -ntl
sudo apt update
to download or transfer files/data from or to a server using FTP, HTTP, HTTPS,
SCP, SFTP, SMB and other supported protocols, installing curl:
sudo apt install curl
To see the
curl https://www.AIMS-localhost.com
copying the certificate to ca certificate folder
cp ca/root-ca/certs/ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
Updating ca certificate folder
update-ca-certificates -v
!cu
→File will run
Exit_new_terminal
In the previous terminal
Configuring nginx derver
sudo apt install nginx
systemctl status nginx
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl status nginx
systemctl start nginx
systemctl status nginx
→Seeing that the server has been configured
Writing into nginx.conf file
nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
Writing code from
https://sites.google.com/view/talhasiddique/home
or from Nginx code
To write:
press ctrl + o
save file:
press Enter
Seeing the nginx.conf file:
vim /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
echo "Thank you for seeing " > /srv/www/htdocs/index.html
To create new directory moving to new terminal
root
su -
srv
cd ../srv
creating directory
mkdir -p www/htdocs
Back to the previous terminal
echo "Thank you for visiting the site" > /srv/www/htdocs/index.html
curl https://www.AIMS-localhost.com
systemctl status nginx
Restart Ubuntu
Moving to root again
su -
echo "hello and welcome to this site" > /srv/www/htdocs/index.html
curl https://www.AIMS-localhost.com
control + click on URL
tree ca
cp /root/ca/root-ca/newcerts/.pem ~talha/
